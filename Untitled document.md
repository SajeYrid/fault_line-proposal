The source of magic in the story comes from ‘Fractures’, which are breaks, or faults, in the fabric of reality. These form along actual geological fault lines whenever an event like an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurs.

It is a mission based and character driven platformer where the player will select a level, or “Mission”, and platform through it, dispatching or avoiding enemies with either stealth or action. The player will pick two unlocked characters and play through the level as them. The player will start with three characters and gradually unlock up to ten, with three bonus ‘secret’ characters. The tone is sci-fi/fantasy. 

🕹️ Level 3: Backstory

Write 2 paragraphs about the world of your game. In paragraph 1, write at least 3 sentences about your game world. In paragraph 2, write at least 3 sentences about the world's history and the character's history.

* The game takes place in a continent spanning dystopian city called ‘Nirvana’ that takes up the majority of Europe, Asia and Africa. This city is ruled by an oligarchical government known as ‘The Council’. The city and council are rife with corruption and organized crime.  
* The protagonists are a group of mercenaries called ‘The Outsiders’ who are trying to make ends meet in the city with blood money. They are composed of various sci-fi and fantasy archetypes.

🕹️ Level 4: Characters

Protagonist (the main character):   
There are ten main characters in all, discounting the three secret characters. The three characters available at the start of the game are as follows. These are copy-pasted from stuff I already wrote about these characters:

Graphite: Graphite appears to be a model sketch of a human figure, complete with scratchy lines, no color, and a cross on the face to indicate where he is facing. His entire body is made up of graphite, hence the name. the de-facto leader of the ‘Outsiders’ mercenary group, unwillingly. This is due to the fact that he’s the best tactical thinker of the group, and he obsessively organizes the mission documents and dossiers. He's constantly redrawing himself, because he doesn't know what he is if he can't be perfect.

Scrapper: An introverted teenage engineering prodigy. Only the rough outline of his face is visible through the welding mask that he's always wearing. No one in the group has ever seen his real face. The group has come up with several theories about why and now has an official ‘crazy conspiracy board’ in the common room. Of course, the real reason why he wears the mask is because he likes it, and he cares not for social convention.

Rookie: A faceless shapeshifter with a strange obsession with baseball. No matter what form it takes, he always gives himself a baseball uniform. Disturbingly, despite having the highest kill count of the group, it seems to have the personality, disposition, and speech patterns of an eight year old. Almost everyone else is unsettled by it. Narrates kills with baseball commentary. Recently, it found a small dog that it named Mascot. Most of the others are extremely concerned for the dog's safety.

Antagonists (the villains, enemies, or obstacles):  
 There are several enemy factions, including the government, several rival mercenary groups, at least one cult, and two mafia families

Other key characters: No other key characters other than the seven other playable characters that aren’t starter characters.

🕹️ Level 5: Target Market / Audience

I’m aiming for the teen/young adult audience, due to the cartoonish violence and superhero-like characters.

🕹️ Level 6: Player Motivations

The main progression system will be unlocking new characters and levels, as well as an endless side mode with procedural level generation.

🕹️ Level 7: Unique Selling Point (USP)

Each character will have a ‘gimmick’ differentiating that character from the others. For example, rookie has one named “force of habit”, which makes it to where he treats all weapons as melee weapons.

🕹️ Level 8: Inspirations & Competition

Inspirations: I don’t actually this I was inspired by anything else. At least, I wasn’t actively thinking of other games or genres to spin concepts off of.

Competition: Dead Cells or Hollow Knight, because they are a similar genre.

🕹️ Level 9: Goals

Fun, really.

Don’t bore the player with overbearing tutorials or frustrating enemies.
